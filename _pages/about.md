I am machine learning researcher and team lead at [Xsensor](https://xsensor.com/) developing deep neural networks for human pose estimation using images extracted from pressure sensors. Previously, I earned PhD in Software Engineering and Intelligent Systems from [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) under supervision of [Dr. Scott Dick](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/faculty/scott-dick). During my PhD, I have worked on designing complex neuro-fuzzy systems for timeseries prediction. My PhD dissertaion received Outstanding [IEEE SMCS](http://thesisgrantinitiative.ieeesmc.hu/about/) Ph.D. Thesis Work on Cybernetics.

## Research Interest

I am interested in developing machine learning algorithms based on fuzzy logic and deep neural network to have robust and interpretable systems.
