I am machine learning researcher and team lead at [Xsensor](https://xsensor.com/) developing deep neural networks for outputs of our sensor. Previously, I earned a PhD in Software Engineering and Intelligent Systems from [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) under supervision of [Dr. Scott Dick](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/faculty/scott-dick). During my PhD, I have worked on designing complex neuro-fuzzy systems for timeseries prediction.
